# Jamaican Draughts (Checkers) - Game Rules

## Setup and Board
- The game is played on an 8x8 board with alternating dark and light squares, where the rightmost corner square on each player's side is dark
- Two players face each other across the board
- Each player starts with 12 pieces (men)
- Pieces are placed on the dark squares of the first three rows closest to each player
- One player uses dark pieces, the other uses light pieces

## Basic Movement and Gameplay
- Dark pieces always make the first move
- Men move forward diagonally one square at a time
- When a man reaches the opposite end of the board, it is "crowned" and becomes a King
- Kings can move forward or backward diagonally along entire diagonal lines

## Captures and Jumps
- A capture occurs when a piece jumps over an opponent's piece to a vacant square beyond it
- The captured piece is removed from the board
- Captures are mandatory - if a player can make a capture, they must do so
- When multiple capture opportunities exist, the player may choose which capture to make
- If a player fails to make a mandatory capture, their piece may be "huffed" (removed from the game)

## Winning and Losing
A player loses the game when either:
- They have no valid moves available on their turn
- All of their pieces have been captured
